ADB WiFi Connect
====================

A simple quality of life project, making it easier to remote connect your daily developer phone so it isn't necessary to have the device connected via USB.


Usage
====================

To use in Android Studio (or other IntelliJ IDE) get the plugin here: https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9717-adb-wifi-connect.

ADB WiFi Connect enables you to ADB connect to your Android devices over WiFi to run and debug your Android apps without needing a USB cable (except for initial connect).
The window shows you a live updated list of Android devices connected to the computer - including their Android version name and SDK levels.
For each USB connected Android device you can connect to it over WiFi and then save the connection for future use so next time you won't even need the cable at all!
After establishing connection over WiFi you can unplug the USB cable and continue developing and debugging wirelessly.
